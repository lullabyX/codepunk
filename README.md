# CodePunk
CodePunk is a cyberpunk themed JavaScript notebook inspired by Stephen Grider's jsnote. It is almost like jupyter notebook but it runs JavaScript. CodePunk client can directly run NodeJS environment code in the browser.

This repository helps with publishing all the packages that work together for the notebook - a cli, a local server and a local client to npm.
